# L2Homage
Customizing Lineage 2


## What is L2Homage
L2Homage (L2H) is a comprehensive modding tool for files with the same datastructure used for Lineage 2 - High Five. 

L2H makes modding Lineage 2 files faster, easier and safer, allowing users to rethink and reshape the world of Lineage 2, providing the hordes of burnt out players with new, exciting content, without having to spend hours learning how to manipulate the data structure.

The hope is to see a bunch of unique, new game worlds appear, instead of relaunches of the same L2 experience weâ€™ve all been through too many times to count.

With this tool, you can edit all weapons, armors, misc items (etcs), recipes, npcs, droplists, spawns, system texts and much, much more. The list goes on, and expands as the project evolves.

## Special Thanks
A special thanks to the people who helped me make L2Homage possible!
L2H wouldn't be here if it wasn't for:
- Anarchy
- Eressea of L2Shrine
- Weedy
- Sepultribe
- L2Miko
- Rootware
- PARADISE
- Badwatermage & the players of L2Knight
- Sindelia of PlayINERA
- Matrix (EDL Team)
- And many, many more who provided answers when I needed them. Thank you! If I forgot to mention anyone, please let me know, you deserve the credit.
- Above all, thank you to the doctors and nurses who kept me alive these past years. L2H is a passion project, developed before, during and after my fight with leukemia. If you find some weird or bad code, that will also be my go-to excuse.

3. Copy and paste the files from your server's "script" folder into the "Data/Server" folder.
4. If you have any images, put them into the Images folder.
5. If you have any AI files, put them into the "Data/AI" folder.
6. Open L2Homage.exe.

## Usage
### Initialization
In the Initialization block, you should see the "start" button. Click it. Everything should start decrypting and loading.
If installation was successful, you should see something similar to this:
![alt text](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76498760/150880428-207ee03f-52f9-4262-a45d-312ecf6ee1f0.png)

Content categories are in the menu on the left. Options are:
* Overview - Log, initialization and export options.
* Classes - Class descriptions, stats, when and how they learn skills, starting equipment, start location and more.
* Droplists - NPC drops.
* Experience - Exp Table for levels 1-99
* Items - Weapons, Armors, Etcs, Sets
* Multisell - Shops, NPC trades
* NPCs
* Recipes
* Skills
* System Text - Chat Filter, Game Tips, NPC Strings, System Messages, System Strings
* Zones - Zone names, Spawn zones, Hunting zones, Raids

Below the categories is a Mini Log. The Mini Log shows you a short description of any edits you performed for a quick confirmation.

Export settings are on the right. Options are:
* Server IP - Input the IP of your server.
* Custom Spawns Only - Export only custom spawns. This is used when creating an entirely custom world. No original NPC spawns will be included in the export.
* Use Export Module - This is for using a custom module to export content. It's only useful if you create your own exporting module and implement it in the source.

Clicking the "Export" button saves any changes and exports both server and client files. If you don't want to export the project, but save it for later, use the "Save" button below Initialization.

### Classes
There are two types of classes. The base classes and the specific classes.
You can choose between class type by clicking one of the two buttons below the ID search field on the left.
#### Base Classes
![classes_text](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76498760/150883485-879fbcb3-31f0-402a-8a6b-1947ba93f654.png)

Base classes are:
* Human Fighter
* Human Magic
* Elf Fighter
* Elf Magic
* Darkelf Fighter
* Darkelf Magic
* Orc Fighter
* Orc Shaman
* Dwarf Fighter
* Kamael Soldier

You can modify their stats individually by clicking on any of the buttons in the four categories on the right, Combat, Stats, Creation and Misc.

#### Specific Classes
![classes_2_text](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76498760/150883772-abfedb42-2117-4fba-a474-ce28192402cd.png)

Specific classes are all classes, including the base classes. 
In this section, you can modify which skills each class can learn, when they learn it, what it costs, any prerequisites and much more.

You can also choose to include another class as a base. Think of classes in L2 as branches or tiers. If you're tier 3, the game considers you tier 1 and tier 2 as well.
Take a Duelist for examples. It includes the "Gladiator" class, which includes the "Warrior" class, which includes the "Fighter" class. A duelist is considered all of those classes. 

Modifying a base class will affect all of the classes which include that specific base class.

---

### Droplists
I wanted to keep droplist editing simple, so I designed a custom system for this purpose. The first thing L2H does, is to _separate_ all drops from NPCs. All the drops are then stored and _assigned_ to each NPC. L2H keeps references to droplists across NPCs, which means you can _reuse_ the same droplists for different NPCs, if you so like. If you assign the same droplist to multiple NPCs, any changes you make to the droplist will affect the drops of all those NPCs. It's pretty neat.

There are two types of droplists, single and multi.

#### Single Droplist
![droplists_text](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76498760/150884830-c309cea9-66e4-49b7-8b6f-07b7748c7ff3.png)
A single droplist contains X amount of _drops_, but only _ONE_ drop can trigger per single droplist. Each drop has:
* %Chance to trigger when killing an assigned NPC.
* Minimum amount dropped when triggered
* Maximum amount dropped when triggered

#### Multi Droplist
![droplists_2_text](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76498760/150885966-c03e11df-1e36-49f9-aa86-5aafccb08706.png)
A multi droplist contains X amount of _single droplists_. Each single droplist can trigger independently.
This is the most commonly used droplist in L2. If you only use single droplists, each NPC would only be able to drop one thing at a time. That'd be a bit boring.

L2H shows which single droplists are assigned, and the probability of them triggering. You can edit this freely. 

**WARNING**

If the trigger chance of all the drops in a single droplist, or all the single droplists in a multi droplist exceeds 100, only the first 100 will work.

Example:
1. Gremlin has a single droplist assigned
2. The single droplist has 5 items that can drop, each with 20% chance to trigger
3. You decide to increase the drop chance of the first item to 50%
4. The gremlin now has:
* 50% chance to drop item 1
* 20% chance to drop item 2
* 20% chance to drop item 3
* 10% chance to drop item 4
* 0% chance to drop item 5

The same applies to single droplists inside of a multi droplist.

**WARNING**

---

### Experience
L2H allows you to modify the experience curve.
![experience_text](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76498760/150886936-3dce12d0-6cab-4145-9ae7-b7084704c6ae.png)
The experience value for each level is visualized with a dot on a graph, and shown in editable boxes on the right. 

To edit the experience curve, you can input the values in the boxes or simply drag the dots if you prefer to work visually.

**WARNING**

Changing the experience curve does not automatically change NPC levels or player levels! Each level is defined by the amount of exp the NPC or player has. Any change to the experience curve should be one of the very first things you do for a project. If you change the experience curve later, you'll have to manually edit all NPCs to fit your new settings. I've tried adding some custom algorithms to alleviate this issue, but it'll only take you so far. 

**WARNING**

#### Experience Algorithms
I've implemented five different experience algorithms. You can always click the "Reset EXP Table" button to revert changes to the EXP table, but any changes made with these algorithms are _permanent_. Make sure you know what you're doing. Also, keep a backup. Always keep a backup.

#### **Recalculate NPC EXPERIENCE based on LEVELS**
Maintains all NPC LEVELS and adjusts the EXPERIENCE values of all NPCs. The EXP value assigned will be the lowest EXP value of that level. 
Example:
1. Orc is level 2 with 300 EXP.
2. You change the EXP curve so level 2 starts at 400 exp.
3. Orc would now be considered level 1, even though all entries still show it as level 2.
4. Clicking the **Recalculate NPC EXPERIENCE based on LEVELS** algorithm will recalculate the EXP value of the NPC and set it to 400.

#### **Recalculate NPC LEVELS based on EXPERIENCE**
Maintains all NPC EXPERIENCE values and adjusts the LEVEL of all NPCs.
Example:
1. Orc is level 2 with 300 EXP.
2. You change the EXP curve so level 2 starts at 400 exp.
3. Orc would now be considered level 1, even though all entries still show it as level 2.
4. Clicking the **Recalculate NPC LEVELS based on EXPERIENCE** algorithm will recalculate the LEVEL of the NPC and set it to 1.

#### **Recalculate NPC EXPERIENCE PER KILL based on LEVELS**
Compares the original level value with the new level value and adjusts the EXPERIENCE PER KILL value by the percentage difference.
**EFFECT IS CUMULATIVE, ONLY DO THIS ONCE PER PROJECT**

#### **Recalculate NPC SKILL POINTS PER KILL based on LEVELS**
Compares the original level value with the new level value and adjusts the SKILL POINTS PER KILL value by the percentage difference..
**EFFECT IS CUMULATIVE, ONLY DO THIS ONCE PER PROJECT**

#### **Recalculate NPC REPUTATION POINTS PER KILL based on LEVELS**
Compares the original level value with the new level value and adjusts the REPUTATION POINTS PER KILL value by the percentage difference..
**EFFECT IS CUMULATIVE, ONLY DO THIS ONCE PER PROJECT**

### Items
L2H lets you edit almost any item in the game. 

To create a new item, find an item you want to use as a template. Select it, and click the "Clone" button. You can also delete an item, but you should only ever delete custom items. Deleting original content causes trouble.
The module button does nothing by default, but you can program your own module for modifying items.

Items are split into four categories:

* Weapons
* Armors - All armor types, including accessories and decorations.
* Etcs - Everything else, including arrows, quest items, consumables and so on.
* Sets

Items share some basic properties, but each item type has properties unique to that type.


I've exposed almost all interesting properties for users to modify. I've hidden the hundreds of properties that aren't of use to content modding. The hidden stuff is mostly client-side stuff, like how an armor piece fits each race model, rotation and so on.

Most properties are self-explanatory, but some are a bit more obscure. Below are descriptions of each item property.

#### Weapons
![Items_Weapon_Text](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76498760/150889947-e492d28b-37d1-4b4d-a365-d92c7cfcf2a5.png)

#### Sets
Sets are a combination of different items that, when equipped together, provide a bonus to the player.

Sets are tied to the **Chest Piece** of the set. The chest holds the reference to all other set pieces. Because of this structure, a chest piece cannot be part of more than one set. Well, maybe it can, but you definitely won't be able to see it reflected in-game. In short, keep sets to one chest piece.

To create a set, make sure no set is selected, then click the "Create New Set" button in the middle of the screen.

Select a set you want to edit. You should see something like this:
![Items_Set](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76498760/150892261-415d69da-6e74-4aa4-adc4-555ec1e5d10d.png)
If you want to add any items to the set, click an empty slot. A popup will appear, showing you only valid options for that slot.
If you want to change any set pieces, click on the set piece. A popup will appear, showing you only valid options for that slot.
If you want to remove an item from a set, right click the set piece.

It's that simple.

Each set has different properties.


| Set Property      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Set Name| Give the set a name. Only visible in L2H| 
| Set ID| Unique integer identifier| 
| Template| ID of set this set is based on| 
| Set Skill| Skill triggered when full set is equipped| 
| Set Effect Skill| Set bonus effect enabled when full set (except for offhand) is equipped| 
| Set Effect Skill (With Additional Slot)| Set bonus effect enabled when full set (including offhand) is equipped. This does not remove the regulard effect skill, but stacks with it| 
| Enchanted Skill and #Enchants Required| Skill enabled when each set item is enchanted to # number of enchants| 
| Description| Description of Set Effect Skill in-game. This has no effect on the actual skill bonus, this is only text visible to the player| 
| Additional Description | Description of Set Effect Skill (With Additional Slot) in-game. This has no effect on the actual skill bonus, this is only text visible to the player| 
| Enchanted Description | Description of Enchanted Skill. This has no effect on the actual skill bonus, this is only text visible to the player| 
| Attribute Bonuses| Fixed bonuses to stats when a full set (except for offhand) is equipped| 

---

### Multisell
Multisell is the term for NPC traders in the game.

Adding a multisell to the actual game requires editing the AI and HTML files, but you can freely edit existing ones, if you don't feel like doing that.
![Multisell](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76498760/150894788-59b50377-cfe1-4c33-8542-78767b2ed474.png)

There are four types of settings for a multisell list.

| Multisell Property      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Taxed| Will this multisell give castle owners tax| 
| Keep Enchants| Will items traded from NPCs keep their enchants when transferred to the player| 
| Show All| Will NPC show all items for sale, or only the items the player can purchase (useful for huge multisell lists)| 
| Show Variations | Will NPC show different types of the same weapon base (used for NPCs selling enchanted stuff)| 

You can also assign a required NPC, as an added security measure. If a multisell has a required NPC, it cannot work for any other NPCs, even if it's assigned to it through AI and HTML.

There are two parts to a multisell list. A sale and a cost.

A sale is one or more items (a bundle) for sale. It is a single transaction.

A cost is the price for that one transaction.

Usually, there's only one thing in a sale, with one or more items as its cost. There _can_ be more items for sale though.

The following options are available for multisell sales:

![sales](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76498760/151060763-11c9f07c-f7f4-4a8d-b6c0-d57506aa6a4f.png)
| Sale      |  |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| A)|  Move sale up (affects in-game order too)
| B)|  Move sale down
| C)|  Remove item from sale bundle. If no other items are in the sale, remove the sale as a whole
| D)|  Add item to the sale bundle
| E)|  Remove sale

You can also adjust the castle tax base value above the costs. This is the amount that's used to generate income for castle owners. It is independent from the actual cost of the item.

---

### NPCs
Modifying NPCs is very similar to modifying items. You can clone or delete NPCs, or edit the _properties_ of their AI variables. This is very different from editing their AI. More on that below.
![NPCs](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76498760/150894909-ddf00150-7a94-4134-b7d4-7374ce43d17f.png)
This is Vrykolakas in all his glory. He was taken from all of us much too soon.

| Base Property      | Description |

| ID| Unique integer ID| 
| Template| ID of NPC this NPC is based on| 
| Name ID| Unique string ID| 
| In-Game Name| Name seen In-Game| 
| Description| Description of NPC| 
| Undead| Is NPC Undead| 
| Can Move| Can NPC move|

At the bottom of the NPC page, you'll see a bar with a list of all the passive skills assigned to this NPC. It can be edited freely as well.

Now, about those AI settings I mentioned earlier.

If you have AI files that can be read, and are placed in the Data/AI folder, you can click the "AI" button next to the delete button. That'll open a popup, showing you all the different variables for the AI assigned to the NPC, _including_ any variables of inherited NPC AI files. For Vrykolakas, it looks like this:

![text](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76498760/151066571-4e9a1f43-3139-486b-9ce2-b7e733997a4d.png)

It's simple to edit. Toggle variables on/off and fill in the values. That's it. You can't change the actual AI this way, but you can modify the existing AI parameters. You can change skills the NPC casts during combat, movement timings and stuff like that.

### Recipes
The recipe page is for editing existing recipes. You cannot add recipes in here. Why, you may ask? Well, that's because recipes are tied to the item that teaches you that recipe. If you want to create a new recipe, go to the items page, find a recipe and clone it. The new, cloned recipe will appear in the Recipes page for you to edit.

![Recipes](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76498760/150894935-9411daa7-093e-4579-b6ff-105ed17a4074.png)

Recipes have at least one outcome, two at most. You can click the outcome buttons to change the result of a recipe.

You can also edit the amount of items a recipe creates. 

Below the amount, you can edit the chance for that specific outcome to happen. **You have to make sure the chances of the outcomes equal 100%.**

Required materials are listed below, in the Materials section. A recipe can have at most 11 types of required materials. You can add or replace an item by clicking the image or an empty slot. To remove an item from the recipe, use right click instead. Simple as that.

Recipes have the following properties:

| Misc Specifics Property      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Owner Item ID| Name of the item referencing this specific recipe| 
| Recipe ID| Unique integer ID| 
| Name ID| Unique string ID| 
| Craft Level| Level of item crafting skill required to learn and use this recipe| 
| MP Cost| MP cost of recipe per craft| 
| Success rate| Success rate of recipe in %| 
| Common Recipe| Is recipe common| 
| Require Extra Craft Recipe| Does recipe require an additional recipe on top of material costs| 
| Description| Description of recipe|

### Skills
L2H allows for modifying and cloning existing skills. 
![Skill](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76498760/150895042-f9d9fa74-2627-4149-8454-cc62b2614df9.png)

Skills are either Active, Passive or Toggleable.

There's _a lot_ of properties for skills. Let's get into it.

First of all, skills can come in different varieties. Each variety of a skill is available in the "Variants" block. You can navigate freely between them.

If you want to add a skill, find it and click "Clone". To add more levels to your new skill, click the "Add Levels" button below the "Levels" block.

You can also delete custom skills and batch edit all levels of a skill at once - we'll get back to that later.

Enchanted skills are not as easily edited in High Five, but I've exposed the variables I could find.


#### Skill Batch Editing
When editing skills with many different levels, it became apparent that it's way too much work to adjust the values of each level individually. 

Enter **BATCH EDITING**!

Select a skill and click the "Batch" button. You'll be greeted with a popup like this:

![Skill_Batch](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76498760/150895078-e9a7f941-fc2a-4e69-93c6-f500c9c14dcd.png)
Select a property with the dropdown on the left and easily edit that property across all levels of selected skill. 

You can write the values manually or drag the points if you prefer to work visually.

The value type is tied to the existing types. If all numbers are integers, only integers are allowed. If L2H sees a float value, floats are allowed.
