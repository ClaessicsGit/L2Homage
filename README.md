# L2Homage
Customizing Lineage 2


## What is L2Homage
L2Homage (L2H) is a comprehensive modding tool for files with the same datastructure used for Lineage 2 - High Five. 

L2H makes modding Lineage 2 files faster, easier and safer, allowing users to rethink and reshape the world of Lineage 2, providing the hordes of burnt out players with new, exciting content, without having to spend hours learning how to manipulate the data structure.

The hope is to see a bunch of unique, new game worlds appear, instead of relaunches of the same L2 experience weâ€™ve all been through too many times to count.

With this tool, you can edit all weapons, armors, misc items (etcs), recipes, npcs, droplists, spawns, system texts and much, much more. The list goes on, and expands as the project evolves.

## Special Thanks
A special thanks to the people who helped me make L2Homage possible!
L2H wouldn't be here if it wasn't for:
- Anarchy
- Eressea of L2Shrine
- Weedy
- Sepultribe
- L2Miko
- Rootware
- PARADISE
- Badwatermage & the players of L2Knight
- Sindelia of PlayINERA
- Matrix (EDL Team)
- And many, many more who provided answers when I needed them. Thank you! If I forgot to mention anyone, please let me know, you deserve the credit.
- Above all, thank you to the doctors and nurses who kept me alive these past years. L2H is a passion project, developed before, during and after my fight with leukemia. If you find some weird or bad code, this will also be my go-to excuse.

## Usage.
### Initialization
In the Initialization block, you should see the "start" button. Click it. Everything should start decrypting and loading.
If installation was successful, you should see something similar to this:

Content categories are in the menu on the left. Options are:
* Overview - Log, initialization and export options.
* Classes - Class descriptions, stats, when and how they learn skills, starting equipment, start location and more.
* Droplists - NPC drops.
* Experience - Exp Table for levels 1-99
* Items - Weapons, Armors, Etcs, Sets
* Multisell - Shops, NPC trades
* NPCs
* Recipes
* Skills
* System Text - Chat Filter, Game Tips, NPC Strings, System Messages, System Strings
* Zones - Zone names, Spawn zones, Hunting zones, Raids

Below the categories is a Mini Log. The Mini Log shows you a short description of any edits you performed for a quick confirmation.

Export settings are on the right. Options are:
* Server IP - Input the IP of your server.
* Custom Spawns Only - Export only custom spawns. This is used when creating an entirely custom world. No original NPC spawns will be included in the export.
* Use Export Module - This is for using a custom module to export content. It's only useful if you create your own exporting module and implement it in the source.

Clicking the "Export" button saves any changes and exports both server and client files. If you don't want to export the project, but save it for later, use the "Save" button below Initialization.

### Classes
There are two types of classes. The base classes and the specific classes.
You can choose between class type by clicking one of the two buttons below the ID search field on the left.
#### Base Classes
![classes_text](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76498760/150883485-879fbcb3-31f0-402a-8a6b-1947ba93f654.png)

Base classes are:
* Human Fighter
* Human Magic
* Elf Fighter
* Elf Magic
* Darkelf Fighter
* Darkelf Magic
* Orc Fighter
* Orc Shaman
* Dwarf Fighter
* Kamael Soldier

You can modify their stats individually by clicking on any of the buttons in the four categories on the right, Combat, Stats, Creation and Misc.

#### Specific Classes
![classes_2_text](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76498760/150883772-abfedb42-2117-4fba-a474-ce28192402cd.png)

Specific classes are all classes, including the base classes. 
In this section, you can modify which skills each class can learn, when they learn it, what it costs, any prerequisites and much more.
You can also choose to include another class as a base. Think of classes in L2 as branches or tiers. If you're tier 3, the game considers you tier 1 and tier 2 as well.
Take a Duelist for examples. It includes the "Gladiator" class, which includes the "Warrior" class, which includes the "Fighter" class. A duelist is considered all of those classes. Changing base classes affects all of the classes which include that specific base class.
